# üí´ About Me:
Hi there! I'm A. Zakaria, and I have quite the story to share with you. I started my career as an electrical engineer, working on power systems for tall buildings. But one day, I discovered my passion for software testing and automation, and it changed everything for me!<br><br>In 2020, I made a big change and started focusing on software testing. It was like solving puzzles, trying to figure out all the different ways that users might interact with software. I learned how to test things manually, carefully going through each step to make sure everything worked correctly.<br><br>After gaining experience with manual testing, I took it a step further and started using tools to automate the testing process. It was like creating scripts that could mimic human behavior, checking if the software stayed strong and reliable no matter what test we threw at it. I used tools like Selenium and Cucumber, which made the whole process much easier.<br><br>As I continued on my journey, I explored more frameworks and tools to enhance my automation skills. I learned about Playwright, which helps me test websites in different web browsers. I also learned about testing RESTful APIs, which are ways for different software systems to talk to each other. And I even learned how to automate tests for mobile applications using a tool called Appium.<br><br>To show my progress and the projects I've worked on, I keep an updated profile on GitHub. It's like a portfolio that shows what I've learned and accomplished in my automation journey.<br><br>I'm always eager to learn and share knowledge with others. If there are new things to discover or technologies that can make software testing better, I'm all for it! Collaboration and mentorship are important to me, as they help us grow together.<br><br>My ultimate goal is to make sure that every user has a flawless experience with the software we create. I love coding, testing, and deploying software with other passionate individuals, all working towards the same goal of delivering high-quality products.<br><br>On a personal note, when I'm not busy with code and automation, I enjoy reading fantasy and horror novels. It's like diving into another world, just like debugging complex code. Both activities require problem-solving skills, and I love the challenge they bring.<br><br>I hope this gives you a better understanding of who I am and what I'm passionate about. If you're on a similar journey or want to collaborate, feel free to reach out! Let's automate tests and make software better, one step at a time.
